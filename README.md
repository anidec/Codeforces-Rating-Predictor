# Codeforces-Rating-Predictor

## Problem Statement
A huge amount of your nerve cells die every time when one think what could be his/her future rating in the upcoming contests. With the increase in the no.of programmers and rapid growth of competition, the curiosity among the programmers is increasing exponentially. A tool needs to be designed which can predict the future rating of the user based on the no.of questions attempted and some other information of the user.

## Objective
With the objective of providing the future rating of the user so that he can practice more and improve his performance, this application is developed & deployed. Codeforces is a website that hosts competitive programming contests. This platform is typically used when preparing for competitive programming contests and provides many features. A user is expected to have an account with a decent rating to use this platform.

## Tools & Technologies used
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* Python
* Flask
* Machine Learning Algorithm
